CURLHandle Manifest

This package contains the following top-level items:

* 10.1+ compatible -- A copy of CURLHandle.framework and CURLHandleTester.app built (along with libcurl) under 10.1, so it's compatible with 10.1 and up.  But there isn't SSL and IPv6 support.

* 10.2+ compatible -- A copy of CURLHandle.framework and CURLHandleTester.app built (along with libcurl) under 10.2; it's not compatible with 10.1, but it offers SSL and IPv6 support.

* CURLHandleSource -- folder containing project that makes CURLHandle.framework.

* CURLHandleTesterSource -- folder containing project that makes CURLHandleTester.app; a useful "template" for making sure your own projects properly include CURLHandle framework.
