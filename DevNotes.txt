CURLHandle Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURLHandle is compatible with Mac OS X 10.2 and up.  For 10.1 compatibility, please see the legacy version 1.9.  Remember that NSURLHandle has been deprecated since 10.4, so you probably don't want to start using CURLHandle for a new project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING THE CURLHANDLE FRAMEWORK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move the appropraite CURLHandle.framework into /Library/Frameworks.  You can then add the framework to your project, and be sure to copy the framework into your application "Frameworks" directory using a copy-files build phase in Project Builder.  This is what CURLHandleTester does, so that it won't require any installation of curl or CURLHandle.framework in order to run.
